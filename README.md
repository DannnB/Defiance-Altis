# Defiance
Defiance is a Zeus v Zeus / Team V Team mission by Nash. He has not worked on it for a long time so I am fixing a couple of bugs and adding in some more stuff. Its an epic mode that should be out there to play. 

*All credit goes to Nash for everything that is on 1.5, i'm only adding to it/modifing bits.*
*My work will be from 1.5a - Dev*

Main issues are:
- CO loops sometimes if people vote on more than one person when there is already a CO
- TWS civs are too high, eg car spawns, parked empty cars. This creates lag even with HC and also spawn infront of players (Visble spawn)
- more to add
