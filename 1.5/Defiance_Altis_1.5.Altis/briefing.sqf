_notes = player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["INDFOR (GREEN) LEADER (ZEUS ROLE)","
Green Team's leader is also the Zeus player for INDFOR. The leader can deploy troops in any of the towns that currently has an active/alive officer. Officers cannot be controlled and will just patrol their respective town. If Blue team enters one of your deployment areas then it will be disabled until they leave the area, unless they manage to kill the officer, in which case it will be permanently disabled.
<br/><br/>
As noted above, if Blue team shut down an HQ they will have the opportunity to pick up intel. This will mark your location on the map to the Blue team. If a Blue team member finds you and kills you then a number of tickets (lives/respawns) will be rewarded to the Blue team. In addition approximately every 15 minutes the number of tickets awarded increases, only resetting once a bounty has been claimed.
"]];

_notes = player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["INDFOR (GREEN) TEAM STRATEGY","
The Green team win the game if they manage to eliminate all of Blue team's tickets. Green team players should note that they are outmatched by Blue team's resources and technology. The aim is to make sure Blue team pay the highest price possible for every gain they make. Green team members can respawn as much as they like and should utilize the ability to spawn at any of the towns containing officers for extra mobility.

_notes = player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["BLUFOR (BLUE) COMMANDERS (ZEUS ROLE)","
Blue team has two Zeus roles on their side. Mission Commander (MC) and Air Commander (AC). MC is the overall leader of the team. The MC is also responsible for spawning and controlling all ground forces. Blue Team also have a MHQ that the MC can issue orders to. The MHQ is a secondary respawn point for Blue team as well as a small spawn area that the MC can use to deploy forces in the field. The MC can spawn troops at the central Blue Team base or in a small radius around the MHQ.
<br/><br/>
The AC role is to coordinate and deploy all Blue team air traffic. Air vehicles can be deployed either inside the Blue team base or at the main airfield. The AC can also remote control any vehicle they have deployed to assist with landing and takeoff of transport vehicles. The AC can also create empty aircraft if they wish to take a direct role in air support. If you enjoy being a pilot and fancy the challenge of managing all the aircraft for your team then this is the role for you.

_notes = player createDiaryRecord ["Diary",["BLUFOR (BLUE) TEAM STRATEGY","
The enemy HQs start the game hidden, somewhere across the cities, towns and villages of Altis. Blue team can obtain intel from local civilians via direct (scroll-wheel) interaction with them. Not all civilians have intel and can only share intel if there is an enemy officer in the region (~5km), if the Blue team keeps turning up no intel then they should relocate to another town. This intel will be marked on the map as white squares, these markings become more and more accurate as more intel is gathered.
<br/><br/>
If a HQ is found and deactivated (BLUFOR player gets near to it) then the INDFOR operations are closed down. This means INDFOR can no longer spawn at the location and the INDFOR Leader can no longer spawn items there as a Zeus player.

Green team win if they manage to inflict a certain number of Blue team player respawns (a.k.a Tickets).
